### 2.2.3 summary
ImageManager and RoundTripper are modeled in the same way except for the number of functions defined by the interface. In general, developers can manually define a structure that uses methods as fields, as shown in the next code.

```go
type Do interface {
    Add(x int, y int) int
    Sub(x int, y int) int
}

type mockDo struct {
    addFunc func(x int, y int) int
    subFunc func(x int, y int) int
}

// Add implements Do.Add function.
type (m *mockDo) Add(x int, y int) int {
    return m.addFunc(x, y)
}

// Sub implements Do.Sub function.
type (m *mockDo) Sub(x int, y int) int {
    return m.subFunc(x, y)
}
```

When the interface is large and complex, the manual method will impose a test burden on the developers, so the community provides automatically generated tools, such as [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery), to ease the burden on the developers.

## 2.3 Additionlly
Sometimes it relies on third-party services, take the PouchContainer client as a typical case.The above describes that Duck Type can complete the test of this case. In addition, we can also complete the request processing by registering the http.Handler and starting mockHTTPServer. It's a relatively harsh way of testing, which is recommended to be used only when the Duck Type test is unsuitable, or be put into the integration test.

> NOTE: Someone in the golang community modified the binary code to accompalish [monkeypatch](https://github.com/bouk/monkey), which is not recommended. Developers are recommended to design and write testable code.

### 2.4 Summary

PouchContainer integrates unit test cases into the code review phase, and reviewers can view the running of test cases at any time.

In the code review phase, code style checking, unit testing, and integration testing should be runned through continuous integration to help reviewers make accurate decisions. Currently, PouchContainer performs code style checks, testing and other operaions primarily through TravisCI/CircleCI and [pouchrobot](https://github.com/pouchcontainer/pouchrobot).
